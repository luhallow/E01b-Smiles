# I followed the assignment directions to the tee and experienced no problems with completing it. For all of the files, I did a lot of trial and error to try and nail down the image as close to the original as I could. It wasn't until I reached the third file that I saw the exact size of the grid was listed at the top, which made the whole thing a lot simpler. When I was attempting to nail down the light catches and eye placements, I tested every x,y pairing from 25 to 55. That was the only portion that really took some time and was a little tedious, but I got the hang of it all. 

# basically, the code I wrote draws smiley faces in a variety of different ways. It starts off incredibly simple and grows in mild complexity from there. The last two programs are the most intense, in which one shows an entire grid of images and the other in which the smiley face is pasted on top of your mouse cursor. I thought it was a very fun and interesting assignment.
